        "#Избор на модел\n",
        "\n",
        "Както вече стана ясно, оценяването на \"разбиране\" става чрез оценка дали на базата на оценявания текст може да се отговори на избрани въпроси. За целта е необходим \"модел\", който получава текст и въпроси и изчислява за всеки въпрос дали текста е достатъчен за да може да му се отговори. Такъв модел е сложен за реализиране и няма еднозначно решение. Има множество различни варианти на модели, които могат да постигнат апроксимация на валидно решение. Изборът на \"най-подходящ\" модел измежду множество такива е необходимо да се осъществи чрез оценящи метрики. В конкретния случай релевантните метрики са:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **True positives (TP)**: Това са случаите, при които моделът правилно предсказва позитивен резултат. Например, ако имаме тест за заболяване, TP брои колко пъти моделът правилно предсказва, че даден човек има заболяването.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **False positives (FP)**: Това са случаите, при които моделът грешно предсказва позитивен резултат. Използвайки същия пример, FP брои колко пъти моделът грешно предсказва, че някой има заболяването, когато всъщност не го има.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **True negatives (TN)**: Това са случаите, при които моделът правилно предсказва негативен резултат. Това брои колко пъти моделът правилно предсказва, че даден човек НЕ има заболяването.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **False negatives (FN)**: Това са случаите, при които моделът грешно предсказва негативен резултат. Това брои колко пъти моделът грешно предсказва, че човек не има заболяването, когато всъщност го има.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Accuracy (Точност)**: Това е процентът на правилно предсказаните случаи от общия брой примери. Изчислява се по следната формула: Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Positive Predictive Value (Precision, Прецизност)**: Колко от предсказаните като позитивни случаи са наистина позитивни. Изчислява се по формулата: Precision = TP / (TP + FP).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **True Positive Rate (Recall, Sensitivity, Чувствителност)**: От всички истински позитивни случаи, колко са били правилно предсказани като такива. Формула: Recall = TP / (TP + FN).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **True Negative Rate (Specificity, Специфичност)**: От всички истински негативни случаи, колко са били правилно предсказани като такива. Формула: Specificity = TN / (TN + FP).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Negative Predictive Value**: От всички предсказани като негативни случаи, колко наистина са негативни. Формула: NPV = TN / (TN + FN).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **F1 score (F1 резултат)**: Хармонично средно между прецизността и чувствителността. Той се използва за балансиране на двата аспекта и е особено полезен, когато класовете са несбалансирани. Формула: F1 = 2 * ((Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)).\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Macro-average F1 Score**: Средната стойност на F1 резултатите за всеки клас, когато имаме повече от два класа. Това означава, че изчисляваме F1 резултат за всеки клас независимо и след това взимаме средната стойност на тези резултати.\n",
        "\n",
        "За изчисляването на горните метрики за всеки модел са нужни дефинирани набор от тестове, за които ще се тества модела. Всеки такъв текст съдържа следното:\n",
        "1. **Текст (масив от изречения)**\n",
        "2. **Въпроси (масив от въпроси)**\n",
        "3. **Отговори (масив от изречения от текста, които за нужни за отговор на въпросите)**\n",

        "След като се изчислят всички метрики за всеки един от моделите на база на тестовете, се придобива представа как се представят различните имплементации и коя имплементация на модел би била най-добър избор.\n",
